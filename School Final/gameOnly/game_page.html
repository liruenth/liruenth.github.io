			<h1>Let's Play a Dragon Game!!</h1>
			A terrible thing has happened. While a mother dragon was off hunting for food in anticipation of her eggs hatching the eggs have rolled into a canyon that she can't get in.<br/>
			Worse still dragon eggs smell very strongly and are highly desired by men and other beasts.<br/>
			Protect the eggs by shooting fire at the invaders. Over time the eggs will hatch and the hatchlings will help you fight.<br/>

			<h3>Controls:</h3>

				<li>Aim with the mouse and press "m" to breathe a fire ball.</li>
				<li>Each dragon can shoot 1 fire ball at a time. The more hatchlings you save the more fire balls you can shoot at a time.</li>
				<li>Enemies appear from the top and work their way down to the eggs. For each that succeeds you will lose an egg.</li>
				<li>Some enemies are harder to defeat than others. The number of shots it takes to defeat one is posted above them.</li>
